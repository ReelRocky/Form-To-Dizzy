FORM TO DIZZY

Description
-----------
This script makes it so a webhook in discord will send a notification when a google form is submited! 

HOW TO SETUP
-----------
- Make a Google Form
- Once Made. Click on the 3 dots in the top right then click Script editor.
- copy everything in script.js and put it in the code place that appears. Change the discord webhook to yours. (Line 2)
- save it. Then go to triggers and create a new one. The function should be called "onSubmit"
- chose your settings. To have it so it says when someone sumbits right away use these settings (Picture in discord.)
- Use it. (I would test by sending a test one before actually using it.)
